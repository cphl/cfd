Phys 447

Not the most user-friendly yet. But can see animation of time-stepped solutions from sample initial conditions.

* Have these files in the same directory: driver.py, simple_animate.py, simple_plot.py, timestep.py
* Run driver.py
* See sample plots and animations (need to close each window before new figure is drawn)
